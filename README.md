# Blazor.Storage

A library to provide access to local storage and session storage in Blazor applications. 

This is a combined fork of [Blazored.SessionStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/SessionStorage) and [Blazored.LocalStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/LocalStorage) which were originally developed by [Chris Sainty](https://github.com/chrissainty).

# Motivation

The original repositories were archived by the author and have not been actively maintained. Due to the age of the codebase and known security vulnerabilities, it became difficult to use the project safely in modern environments.

The goal of this project is to revive and improve upon the original work, keeping it secure, up-to-date, and usable for the community.
